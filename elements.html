										<h1>About me</h1>

									<!-- Content -->
										
										<p> Hello, I am Austin Suess (A.K.A Moose). I am currently enrolled at Georgia Tech and plan on getting my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering
										with focuses in Power Systems and either Electronic Devices or Signal Processing.<br> <br>
									 	I transfered to Georgia Tech in the Spring of 2024, and while I was at my previous college, I was a student Athlete.I was given the oppurtunity to wrestle, and I was the Schools 
										first ever All-American (and Double All-American- Scholar and Placing at Nationals). While at Southwest Virginia CC, my previous college, I was able to complete mutliple certificates
										and get my A.S in Engineering (Reference Resume). With concurring injurries and personal thought, 
										I decided to focus more on my academics and pursue my degree without having the effects of wrestling. <br><br>
										In my Free time I love volunteering at my home church; Serving, leading, or just just getting to know the families better. I did wrestle, so I enjoy doing some sort of physical activity if time 
										allows me to - Being at Tech, doesn't give you much free time. I enjoy being out at the lake and just enjoying the weather while listening to music.
										I plan on trying out for the Cheer team and may participate in I.M clubs - Like Pickleball. I think that is the greatest sport as of right now. <br><br>
										Adversity doesn't just reveal who we are at our lowest; it defines the resilience and character we bring to the surface in those moments of rock bottom. <br> <br>
										"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope" <br> Jeremiah 29:11
										</p>
